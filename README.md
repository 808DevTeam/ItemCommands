# ItemCommands
Add commands to certain items! The commands will be executed on tap as configured on config.yml! 

# How to setup
First of all, install the plugin, restart server. Then go on config.yml, you'll find a starting guide there also. For making everything simple, here is another demo

`"ItemID:Damage":
  
  name: "Item's name"
  
  lore:
    - "Item's lore"
    - "can add as much as you want"
  
  runAs: 0 # 0 - player, 1 - op, 2 - console
 
  commands:
    - "say this doesn't work because I don't have op!"
    - "me But this works, I don't know why :P"`
